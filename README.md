# OpenGL-Animation
An OpenGL animation using proper lighting, shading, and rendering techniques.
Running should be as simple running the EXE. (Only on windows)
Use arrow keys to rotate the camera.

When I uploaded this project a couple of years ago, I didn't upload the jpegs for the background and since then I've lost the files so I used a replacement background. Oh well.
